## Talks

### Flex with Ruby on Rails

I will gabe this talk at the AdobeMax 360 Unconference on Wednesday October 5th 2011. For more information see http://www.360flex.com/about/360max/. This talk was originally scheduled for the Flex track at Adobe Max, but was
then "promoted" to the 360Flex unconference as the topic is more specialized https://max.adobe.com/schedule/by-session/flex-ruby-on-rails-and-the-cloud/S3441. 

You can find a recording of a preview I gave of this talk at http://n-so.com/screencasts.html, see screencast #9 Flex With Ruby on Rails talk - An AdobeMax preview
