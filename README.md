# Daniel Wanja's Talks

A bunch of my talks on Ruby on Rails and related matters.

## In progress

### FlexUnit 4 - Unit Testing Made Simple..sure!

I will give this talk at the Denver Flex User Group on September 15th 2011. http://www.ria5280.org/calendar/event/2011/9/15/263001

This is an early outline.

### FlexRailsIn

I will give this talk at the AdobeMax 360 Unconference on Wednesday October 5th 2011. For more information see http://www.360flex.com/about/360max/. This talk was originally scheduled for the Flex track at Adobe Max, but was
then "promoted" to the 360Flex unconference as the topic is more specialized https://max.adobe.com/schedule/by-session/flex-ruby-on-rails-and-the-cloud/S3441.
