FlexUnit 4

In this presentation I will show the features of FlexUnit 4 that enable you to do test units for your Flex project.

Historically FlexUnit 4 was born from the collaboration of Michael Labriola and the Flex development team. Original FlexUnit 1 wasn’t the most appropriate testing framework as it was lacking support in areas such a asynchronous and event based code testing. So Michael created an alternative testing framework, Fluint, which was way nicer to test Flex applications. And FlexUnit 4 inherit many things from Fluint.

Demos:

01. FU_01_helloworld
   select Calculator and create a test case
   show meta data
   add a first test

02. FU_03_weather
  shows how to test an HTTPRequest
  shows that it’s not predictable…hey, the weather changes
  what to do to test http errors, hey google doesn’t fail often
  using mocks
  change the design for testability

03. Validator Component or Login form
  test “Login” button is disabled by default
  test validation error when confirmation password is not right
  test validation error when password is too short

04. Big App
  show that it cannot be tested
  move filtering into model
  move selected item into model

Todo
	continue example code…make Mocks work
	create a LoginForm and test it

Things to cover:
Exception handling:
Async:
	- asyncResponder
	- asyncHandler
	- handleEvent
Hamcrest
Parameterized Testing via Method
