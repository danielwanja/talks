Rails Architecture  (3 min)

   show HttpService
	make one query

Rails Resource (3 min)
	explain routes
	one resource
   show one resource
   In Flex that makes 5 HttpService instance

   show Rails
   show Flex

Rails Nested Resource (3 min)

   direct from Flex now wise…but can do (see my gem :-)
   controlled by Rails

    Tada!

Installing Rails (should I show that)
  OSX: $ gem install rails
  Windows: RailsInstaller (todo: find link)


TODO:

	continue diagrams on paper
		the one with the db  (browser->rails->db)
		the ones with MongoDb, Redis, Memcache?

	remove "dust" from rails examples I have
	
	start real graphics (learn Keynote, OmniGraffle)
